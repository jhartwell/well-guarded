well-guarded
============

well-guarded is an attempt to bring pattern matching to C#. While there are a few
.NET languages that already support pattern matching, it is one thing that is 
lacking in C#. This is an attempt to gracefully bring it to C#


How it works
============

well-guarded uses closures,delegates (in the form of Func<T>) and operator overloading to bring
the experience of pattern matching to the C# language. By inheriting from the Guard class and then 
providing your own delagates that close over the variables that you are test, you will be able to mimic
pattern matching. Examples are to follow.

Requirements
============
This is created in Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0, however, it can run on .NET 3.5 It will
not run on any .NET version before that since it uses Func<T> which was introduced in .NET 3.5 

Licensing
=========
This is licensed as BSD (modified). If you end up using this, it would be super cool if you could let me know. I
would love to be able to list people/projects that use this library.
